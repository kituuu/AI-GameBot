# NEAT AI Implementation on IcyTower Clone

In this era of AI everyone tries to think parallel to AI, neural network, NLP, ML , DL, etc. To stay updated with the world we should explore new tech stacks and AI algorithm one such algorithm is NEAT (Neuro Evolution of Augemented Topology) which is a genetic algorithm. 


This project aim to create a AI to play the old retro game icy tower. This project uses NEAT(Neuro Evolution of Augemented Topology) algorithm to generate a neural network. The Scope of this project is to generate a good enough neural network which can score 2000+ score on average.

If you wish to learn more about NEAT algorithm and it's working, you should check the official NEAT documentations and should also read the starting research papers mentioned in the documentation for better understanding.
